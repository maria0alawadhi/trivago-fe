      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        At Trivago, our mission is to empower travelers to easily and quickly
        reserve their perfect hotel stay. We built this app with the goal of
        making the hotel booking process seamless and enjoyable for our users.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Trivago, you can search for hotels, compare rates, and securely
        book your reservation all in one place. But we didn't stop there - we
        also built in a robust review system so you can see authentic feedback
        from past guests. And if your plans change, you can easily delete or
        edit your reservation through our app.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're constantly working to develop Trivago even further, adding new
        features and improving the user experience to make travel planning
        easier than ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of this would be possible without our incredible team. From the
        engineers who coded the app, to the designers who crafted the intuitive
        interface, to the customer support specialists who are here to help -
        every member of the Trivago family played a crucial role. We're proud of
        what we've built, and we're excited for you to experience it.
