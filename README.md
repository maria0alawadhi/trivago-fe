### ***Description***
#### The hotel rooms booking system will allow hotel administrators to manage their room inventory, with the ability to add, view, update, and delete rooms for each of their hotels. Users will be able to sign in to the system and browse the available rooms across all hotels, selecting and booking the ones they wish to stay in. The system will maintain up-to-date room availability information, updating the database as bookings are made. The admin interface will provide a centralized platform for managing the hotel's room offerings, while the user-facing front-end will offer a seamless booking experience, ensuring efficient hotel room management and reservation capabilities.
